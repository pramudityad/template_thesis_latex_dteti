	M2M authentication is an important component for securing FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) communication, but leaked credentials are the most common factor that leads to data breaches. It ensures that only authorized devices can access and exchange data with each other. This study aims to assess the risks associated with M2M authentication and identify those risks.
	In addition, this study will use a risk-based approach to identify and assess potential risks associated with M2M authentication. This will involve identifying potential threat actors, vulnerabilities, and impact of successful attacks. The study will also evaluate current M2M authentication methods and their effectiveness in reducing identified risks.
