	abstract = {Web applications for consumers often require authenticated users in order to offer their services. In this context, consumers expect authentication to be easy to use and their resources to be secured properly. But, authentication in web applications is often vulnerable, e.g., passwords can be stolen, fingerprints can be imitated or the authentication protocol implementation may have a security flaw. Several best practices solving this problem evolved in several web applications. We analyzed such solutions that continuously and transparently collect data on the user to learn their typical behavior and detect anomalies. Based on this analysis, we describe the security pattern risk-based authenticator and exemplify its application in the SmartCampus, a service-oriented web application.},

	abstract = {E-books are widely used as an important resource in learning. The most common way to use e-books is to incorporate them while a learning interaction is in progress. However, some learning styles are better supported inversely: e-books take the lead and are used to initiate and bind learning communications to the topics in focus. Unfortunately, existing e-book formats cannot accommodate this need effectively, potentially causing learning interactions to lose grip on the intended discussion framework. Inability to bind a conversation with the materials in the first place can also introduce overhead cost to the readers due to the burden of bringing the materials into the discussion.
	In this work, we add the capability of e-books to serve as an interaction platform. An e-book is considered as a collection of objects indicating topics of learning discussions. Asynchronous conversation is anchored to one or more topic, and defined by a context that specifies participants and communications among them. Communication is modeled after a reactive mechanism by using event-action pairs. The proposed framework also accommodates dynamics within discussions, as well as structured discussions commonly found in many learning environments.},
